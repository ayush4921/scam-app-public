    a: "TRUE",

    b: "FALSE",
    
    correct: "a",
    explanation:"Anyone who have knowledge of the 16-digit Card Number, along with other details such as Cardholder Name, Expiry Date and CVV(a 3 or 4-digit checksum found only on the credit card to prove ownership) will be able to make purchases just like the authorised Cardholder. Credit card details should only be known by yourself; do not share it with anyone."
