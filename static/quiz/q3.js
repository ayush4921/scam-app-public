    question: "(Q1/3) Because the username identifies me as a banking customer, I should let the banking officer know when they ask me to provide.",
    a: "TRUE",
    b: "FALSE",
    correct: "b",
    explanation:"Banking and financial institutions in Singapore will never request for your username, password and even OTP as there is a law prohibiting them to do so. You should reject such requests flatly."
}, {
    question: "(Q2/3) For convenience, I can click on the links in an email/SMS received from the bank.",
    a: "TRUE",
    b: "FALSE",
    
    correct: "b",
    explanation:"It is a requirement in Singapore for banks not to include links in email/SMS as this has already became a common trick used by scammers to direct unsuspecting victims to a fake banking look-alike website. Keying username and password sends the username and password to the scammers, who can use it to login and perform unauthorised transactions including funds transfer."
}, {
    question: "(Q3/3) It is safe for me to update my bank app by clicking on a link in an SMS/email.",
    a: "TRUE",
    b: "FALSE",
   
    correct: "b",
    explanation:"Banks in Singapore are no longer allowed to share links in email/SMS. It is strongly recommended to update apps only via the official Google Play Store or the Apple App Store."
